@article{Crassin2009,
abstract = {We propose a new approach to efficiently render large volumetric data sets. The system achieves interactive to real-time rendering performance for several billion voxels. Our solution is based on an adaptive data representation depending on the current view and occlusion information, coupled to an efficient ray-casting rendering algorithm. One key element of our method is to guide data production and streaming directly based on information extracted during rendering. Our data structure exploits the fact that in CG scenes, details are often concentrated on the interface between free space and clusters of density and shows that volumetric models might become a valuable alternative as a rendering primitive for real-time applications. In this spirit, we allow a quality/performance trade-off and exploit temporal coherence. We also introduce a mipmapping-like process that allows for an increased display rate and better quality through high quality filtering. To further enrich the data set, we create additional details through a variety of procedural methods. We demonstrate our approach in several scenarios, like the exploration of a 3D scan (81923 resolution), of hypertextured meshes (163843 virtual resolution), or of a fractal (theoretically infinite resolution). All examples are rendered on current generation hardware at 20--90 fps and respect the limited GPU memory budget.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a spatially-variant (SV) mathematical morphology theory for gray-level signals and images in the Euclidean space. The proposed theory preserves the geometrical concept of the structuring function, which provides the foundation of classical morphology and is essential in signal and image processing applications. We define the basic SV gray-level morphological operators (i.e., SV gray-level erosion, dilation, opening, and closing) and investigate their properties. We demonstrate the ubiquity of SV gray-level morphological systems by deriving a kernel representation for a large class of systems, called V-systems, in terms of the basic SV graylevel morphological operators. A V-system is defined to be a gray-level operator, which is invariant under gray-level (vertical) translations. Particular attention is focused on the class of SV flat gray-level operators. The kernel representation for increasing V-systems is a generalization of Maragos' kernel representation for increasing and translation-invariant function-processing systems. A representation of V-systems in terms of their kernel elements is established for increasing and upper-semi-continuous V-systems. This representation unifies a large class of spatially-variant linear and non-linear systems under the same mathematical framework. Finally, simulation results show the potential power of the general theory of gray-level spatially-variant mathematical morphology in several image analysis and computer vision applications.},

Un des premiers objectifs de ce travail est de caract\'{e}riser la microstructure par le d\'{e}veloppement des m\'{e}thodologies de description topologique de la g\'{e}om\'{e}trie en 3D. Ces op\'{e}rateurs g\'{e}om\'{e}triques sont bas\'{e}s sur la math\'{e}matique algorithmique (g\'{e}om\'{e}trie discr\`{e}te) permettant de r\'{e}duire l'information \`{a} des "squelettes" discrets. L'application des squelettes permet la d\'{e}termination d'une "fonction de distribution topologique" bas\'{e}e sur une description du type de r\'{e}seaux (sites et liens). Les descripteurs de forme sont ensuite appliqu\'{e}s sur des \'{e}chantillons g\'{e}n\'{e}r\'{e}s num\'{e}riquement (g\'{e}om\'{e}tries simples, complexes et "fissur\'{e}es"). Ainsi, diverses analyses morphologiques et topologiques sont r\'{e}alis\'{e}es pour \'{e}tudier le rapport g\'{e}om\'{e}trique entre les sections et leurs volumes respectifs. Le deuxi\`{e}me objectif de ce travail est la mod\'{e}lisation des processus de transferts de fluides \`{a} travers des squelettes. Deux m\'{e}thodes sont pr\'{e}sent\'{e}es: une m\'{e}thode g\'{e}om\'{e}trique et une bas\'{e}e sur l'analogie \'{e}lectrique. La m\'{e}thode de simulation g\'{e}om\'{e}trique est appliqu\'{e}e sur les sections et les volumes pour l'observation de l'influence de la topologie dans l'intrusion et l'extrusion d'un fluide non-mouillant. Un mod\`{e}le de pores cylindriques \'{e}l\'{e}mentaires connect\'{e}s est propos\'{e} pour estimer une conductivit\'{e} hydraulique \`{a} saturation \`{a} partir du "graphe" associ\'{e} au squelette. La m\'{e}thode de simulation utilise une analogie \'{e}lectrique \`{a} travers d'une solution num\'{e}rique optimis\'{e}e pour r\'{e}soudre le syst\`{e}me.

The introductory chapter summarizes some basic notions and concepts of mathematical morphology. In this chapter, a novice reader learns, among other things, that complete lattice theory is generally accepted as the appropriate algebraic framework for mathematical morphology. In the following chapter it is explained that, for a number of cases, the complete lattice framework is too limited, and that one should, instead, work on (complete) inf-semilattices. Other chapters discuss granulometries, analytical aspects of mathematical morphology, and the geometric character of mathematical morphology. Also, connectivity, the watershed transform and a formal language for morphological transformations are being discussed. This book has many interesting things to offer to researches in computer science, mathematics, physics, electrical engineering and other disciplines.},

insensitive to noise and other disturbances. The algorithm has been
tested in several applications. Two of them are briefly presented. In
the first application the outlines of common tools are matched to
gray-level images of the same tools, with overlapping. In the second
application lake edges from aerial photographs are matched to lake edges
from a map, with translation, rotation, scale, and perspective changes.

Assuming a model where pixel intensity is proportional to the coverage of a pixel, we show that the presented method provides error-free measurements of the length of straight boundary segments in the case of nonquantized pixel values. For a more realistic situation, where pixel values are quantized, we derive optimal estimates that minimize the maximal estimation error. We show that the estimate converges toward a correct value as the number of gray levels tends toward infinity. The method is easy to implement; we provide the complete pseudocode. Since the method utilizes only a small neighborhood, it is very easy to parallelize. We evaluate the estimator on a set of concave and convex shapes with known perimeters, digitized at increasing resolution. In addition, we provide an example of applicability of the method on real images, by suggesting appropriate preprocessing steps and presenting results of a comparison of the suggested method with other local approaches.},

Several pruning methods for IMA skeletons are introduced (constant, linear and square-root pruning) and their properties studied. The algorithm for computing the IMA skeleton is based upon the feature transform, using a modification of a linear-time algorithm for Euclidean distance transforms. The skeletonization algorithm has a time complexity which is linear in the number of input points, and can be easily parallelized. We present experimental results for several data sets, looking at skeleton quality, memory usage and computation time, both for 2D images and 3D volumes.},

acceleration techniques and the alleged superiority of one approach over

have led to the same conclusion: a space partitioning method that allows
the fastest rendering of one scene often fails with another.
Specialization may be the answer. This has always been pursued,
consciously or not, in developing various ray-tracing systems. Despite
our new algorithm's impressive efficiency, we don't interpret the new
method as the fastest ray-tracing scene decomposition possible. This is
because our recent groundwork experiments with a derivative method

timings that were better by approximately 50\%},

abstract = {This paper introduces a fast and efficient algorithm for surface reconstruction. As many algorithms of this kind, it produces a piecewise linear approximation of a surface S from a finite, sufficiently dense, subset of its points. Originally, the starting point of this work does not come from the computational geometry field. It is inspired by an existing numerical scheme of surface convection developed by Zhao, Osher and Fedkiw. We have translated this scheme to make it depend on the geometry of the input data set only, and not on the precision of some grid around the surface. Our algorithm deforms a closed oriented pseudo-surface embedded in the 3D Delaunay triangulation of the sampled points, and the reconstructed surface consists of a set of oriented facets located in this 3D Delaunay triangulation. This paper provides an appropriate data structure to represent a pseudo-surface, together with operations that manage deformations and topological changes. The algorithm can handle surfaces with boundaries, surfaces of high genus and, unlike most of the other existing schemes, it does not involve a global heuristic. Its complexity is that of the 3D Delaunay triangulation of the points. We present some results of the method, which turns out to be efficient even on noisy input data},

@article{CAI1999a,
abstract = {Purpose: We present a validation study of CT and PET lung image registration and fusion based on the chamfer-matching method. Methods and Materials: The contours of the lung surfaces from CT and PET transmission images were automatically segmented by the thresholding technique. The chamfer-matching technique was then used to register the extracted lung surfaces. Arithmetic means of distance between the two data sets of the pleural surfaces were used as the cost function. Matching was then achieved by iteratively minimizing the cost function through three-dimensional (3D) translation and rotation with an optimization method. Results: Both anatomic thoracic phantom images and clinical patient images were used to evaluate the performance of our registration system. Quantitative analysis from five patients indicates that the registration error in translation was 2â3 mm in the transverse plane, 3â4 mm in the longitudinal direction, and about 1.5 degree in rotation. Typical computing time for chamfer matching is about 1 min. The total time required to register a set of CT and PET lung images, including contour extraction, was generally less than 30 min. Conclusion: We have implemented and validated the chamfer-matching method for CT and PET lung image registration and fusion. Our preliminary results show that the chamfer-matching method for CT and PET images in the lung area is feasible. The described registration system has been used to facilitate target definition and treatment planning in radiotherapy.},

abstract = {This report deals with the reconstruction of the distribution of membrane thickness T from that of orthogonal length Lo, measured in random section planes. In such planes the membrane appears as a band and the linear distance from one of its boundaries perpendicular to the opposite one is the length of the orthogonal intercept. Using a membrane model, an integral equation relating the probability density functions of orthogonal intercept length f(lo) and membrane thickness g(tau) is derived. Relations between moments are derived and the analytic solution to the problem of reconstructing g(tau) from f(lo) is given. The parametric approach by which it assumed that g(tau) has some known analytic form with unknown parameters is considered, and the use of a suggested analytic form for describing the thickness distribution of the human glomerular basement membrane is discussed.},

@article{Aizawa2009,
abstract = {Quadtrees and linear quadtrees are well-known hierarchical data structures to represent square images of size 2(r) x 2(r). Finding the neighbors of a specific leaf node is a fundamental operation for many algorithms that manipulate quadtree data structures. In quadtrees, finding neighbors takes O(r) computational time for the worst case, where r is the resolution (or height) of a given quadtree. Schrack [1] proposed a constant-time algorithm for finding equal-sized neighbors in linear quadtrees. His algorithm calculates the location codes of equal-sized neighbors; it says nothing, however, about their existence. To ensure their existence, additional checking of the location codes is needed, which usually takes O(r) computational time. In this paper, a new algorithm to find the neighbors of a given leaf node in a quadtree is proposed which requires just O(1) (i.e., constant) computational time for the worst case. Moreover, the algorithm takes no notice of the existence or nonexistence of neighbors. Thus, no additional checking is needed. The new algorithm will greatly reduce the computational complexities of almost all algorithms based on quadtrees.},

abstract = {We present a method for simulating water and smoke on an unrestricted octree data structure exploiting mesh refinement techniques to capture the small scale visual detail. We propose a new technique for discretizing the Poisson equation on this octree grid. The resulting linear system is symmetric positive definite enabling the use of fast solution methods such as preconditioned conjugate gradients, whereas the standard approximation to the Poisson equation on an octree grid results in a non-symmetric linear system which is more computationally challenging to invert. The semi-Lagrangian characteristic tracing technique is used to advect the velocity, smoke density, and even the level set making implementation on an octree straightforward. In the case of smoke, we have multiple refinement criteria including object boundaries, optical depth, and vorticity concentration. In the case of water, we refine near the interface as determined by the zero isocontour of the level set function.},

abstract = {We establish a connection between two previously unrelated topics: a particular discrete version of conformal geometry for triangulated surfaces, and the geometry of ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic three-space. Two triangulated surfaces are considered discretely conformally equivalent if the edge lengths are related by scale factors associated with the vertices. This simple definition leads to a surprisingly rich theory featuring M$\backslash$"obius invariance, the definition of discrete conformal maps as circumcircle preserving piecewise projective maps, and two variational principles. We show how literally the same theory can be reinterpreted to addresses the problem of constructing an ideal hyperbolic polyhedron with prescribed intrinsic metric. This synthesis enables us to derive a companion theory of discrete conformal maps for hyperbolic triangulations. It also shows how the definitions of discrete conformality considered here are closely related to the established definition of discrete conformality in terms of circle packings.},

abstract = {Display of large volumes, progressive rendering and selective refinements are some of the operations supported by multiresolution technology. In this paper, a general framework relying on the use of such techniques applied to volume data rendering is presented. Based on a pyramidal representation of data, two aspects of our work are considered. First, the decimation algorithm itself is described. The general principle consists in gradually removing nodes of a structural graph previously established while respecting constraints. A second part introduces the refinement of preliminary obtained Levels of Details (LOD). The problem is to preserve as well as possible the initial volume of studied objects. The goal is to build an interactive system of visualization for the analysis of volumetric data. The speed of treatments associated with a good visualization should enable to achieve a 3D survey of a natural object in a quasi-interactive manner. The method has been successfully applied to both synthetic and real data (medical imaging).},

We also define an averaging mask with local support which, when applied with the iterated convolution operator, behaves like an averaging with large support. The interesting property of the latter averaging is the way the resulting weights are distributed: given a digital surface obtained by discretization of a differentiable surface of , the masks isocurves are close to the Riemannian isodistance curves from the center of the mask. We eventually use the iterated averaging followed by convolutions with differentiation masks to estimate partial derivatives and then normal vectors over a surface. The number of iterations required to achieve a good estimate is determined experimentally on digitized spheres and tori. The precision of the normal estimation is also investigated according to the digitization step.},

Using the Voronoi diagram of the input point set, we deduce a tensor field whose principal axes and eccentricities locally represent respectively the most likely direction of the normal to the surface, and the confidence in this direction estimation. An implicit function is then computed by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem such that its gradient is most aligned with the principal axes of the tensor field, providing a best-fitting isosurface reconstruction. Our approach possesses a number of distinguishing features. In particular, the implicit function optimization provides resilience to noise, adjustable fitting to the data, and controllable smoothness of the reconstructed surface. Finally, the use of simplicial meshes (possibly restricted to a thin crust around the input data) and (an)isotropic Laplace operators renders the numerical treatment simple and robust.},

abstract = {Chamfer distances are widely used in image analysis and many authors have investigated the computation of optimal chamfer mask coefficients. Unfortunately, these methods are not systematized: calculations have to be conducted manually for every mask size or image anisotropy. Since image acquisition (e.g. medical imaging) can lead to discrete anisotropic grids with unpredictable anisotropy value, automated calculation of chamfer mask coefficients becomes mandatory for e cient distance map computations. This article presents an automatic construction for chamfer masks of arbitrary sizes. This allows, first, to derive analytically the relative error with respect to the Euclidean distance, in any 3-D anisotropic lattice, and second, to compute optimal chamfer coefficients. In addition, the resulting chamfer map verifies discrete norm conditions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method for voxelization of solid objects containing sharp details. Voxelization is a sampling process that transforms a continuously defined object into a discrete one represented as a voxel field. The voxel field can be used for rendering or other purposes, which often involve a reconstruction of a continuous approximation of the original object. Objects to be voxelized need to fulfill certain representability conditions; otherwise, disturbing artifacts appear during reconstruction. The method proposed here extends the traditional distance-based voxelization by an a-priori detection of sharp object details and their subsequent modification in such a way that the resulting object to be voxelized fulfills the representability conditions. The resulting discrete objects are represented by means of truncated (i.e., narrow-band) distance fields, which provide reduction of memory requirements and further processing by level set techniques. This approach is exemplified by two classes of solid objects that normally contain such sharp details: implicit solids and solids resulting from CSG operations. In both cases, the sharp details are rounded to a specific curvature dictated by the sampling distance.},

abstract = {Trabecular or cancellous bone, the type of bone found in the vertebrae and near the joints of long bones, consists of a network of plates and struts. Accurate measurement of trabecular thickness is of significant interest, for example, to assess the effectiveness of anabolic (bone forming) agents of patients with osteoporosis. Here, we introduce a new fuzzy distance transform (FDT)-based thickness computation method that obviates binary segmentation and that can effectively deal with images acquired at a voxel size comparable to the typical trabecular bone thickness. The method's robustness is shown on the basis of micro-CT images of human trabecular bone, resampled at progressively coarser resolution and after application of rotation and addition of noise as a means to simulate the in vivo situation. Reproducibility of the method is demonstrated with micro-CT images by comparing histograms of thickness within and between data sets and with micro-MRI volume data sets of human volunteers imaged repeatedly. Finally, with in vivo micro-MR images from a prior study in rabbits subjected to corticosteroid exposure, it is demonstrated that short-term treatment resulting in trabecular thinning can be quantified with the new method.},

abstract = {Mesh parameterization is a fundamental problem in computer graphics as it allows for texture mapping and facilitates many mesh processing tasks. Although there exists a variety of good parameterization methods for meshes that are topologically equivalent to a disk, the segmentation into nicely parameterizable charts of higher genus meshes has been studied less. In this paper we propose a new segmentation method for the generation of charts that can be flattened efficiently. The integrated Gaussian curvature is used to measure the developability of a chart, and a robust and simple scheme is proposed to integrate the Gaussian curvature. The segmentation approach evenly distributes Gaussian curvature over the charts and automatically ensures a disklike topology of each chart. For numerical stability, we use an area on the Gauss map to represent Gaussian curvature. The resulting parameterization shows that charts generated in this way have less distortion compared to charts generated by other methods.},

abstract = {We address the problem of curvature estimation from sampled compact sets. The main contribution is a stability result: we show that the gaussian, mean or anisotropic curvature measures of the offset of a compact set K with positive \$\backslash mu\$-reach can be estimated by the same curvature measures of the offset of a compact set K' close to K in the Hausdorff sense. We show how these curvature measures can be computed for finite unions of balls. The curvature measures of the offset of a compact set with positive \$\backslash mu\$-reach can thus be approximated by the curvature measures of the offset of a point-cloud sample. These results can also be interpreted as a framework for an effective and robust notion of curvature.},

abstract = {We propose a Parallel Banding Algorithm (PBA) on the GPU to compute the exact Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) for a bi- nary image in 2D and higher dimensions. Partitioning the image into small bands to process and then merging them concurrently, PBA computes the exact EDT with optimal linear total work, high level of parallelism and a good memory access pattern. Thiswork is the first attempt to exploit the enormous power of the GPU in com- puting the exact EDT, while priorworks are only on approximation. Compared to these other algorithms in our experiments, our exact algorithm is still a few times faster in 2D and 3D for most input sizes. We illustrate the use of our algorithm in applications such as computing the Euclidean skeleton using the integer medial axis transform, performing morphological operations of 3D volumetric data, and constructing 2D weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams.},

abstract = {We present a practical algorithm for computing robust, multiscale curve and surface skeletons of 3D objects. Based on a model which follows an advection principle, we assign to each point on the skeleton a part of the object surface, called the collapse. The size of the collapse is used as a uniform importance measure for the curve and surface skeleton, so that both can be simplified by imposing a single threshold on this intuitive measure. The simplified skeletons are connected by default, without special precautions, due to the monotonicity of the importance measure. The skeletons possess additional desirable properties: They are centered, robust to noise, hierarchical, and provide a natural skeleton-to-boundary mapping. We present a voxel-based algorithm that is straightforward to implement and simple to use. We illustrate our method on several realistic 3D objects.},

abstract = {Distance transforms are an important computational tool for the processing of binary images. For an n x n image, distance transforms can be computed in time (n) on a mesh-connected computer and in polylogarithmic time on hypercube related structures. We investigate the possibilities of computing distance transforms in polylogarithmic time on the pyramid computer and the mesh of trees. For the pyramid, we obtain a polynomial lower bound using a result by Miller and Stout, so we turn our attention to the mesh of trees. We give a very simple (9(log n) algorithm for the distance transform with respect to the Ll-metric, an (9(log 2 n) algorithm for the transform with respect to the L\~{}-metric, and find that the Euclidean metric is much more difficult. Based on evidence from number theory, we conjecture the impossibility of computing the Euclidean distance transform in poly- logarithmic time on a mesh of trees. Instead, we approximate the distance transform up to a given error. This works for any Lk-metric and takes time (9(log 3 n)},

@article{Sarrut2007,
abstract = {Motion estimation is an important issue in radiation therapy of moving organs. In particular, motion estimates from 4-D imaging can be used to compute the distribution of an absorbed dose during the therapeutic irradiation. We propose a strategy and criteria incorporating spatiotemporal information to evaluate the accuracy of model-based methods capturing breathing motion from 4-D CT images. This evaluation relies on the identification and tracking of landmarks on the 4-D CT images by medical experts. Three different experts selected more than 500 landmarks within 4-D CT images of lungs for three patients. Landmark tracking was performed at four instants of the expiration phase. Two metrics are proposed to evaluate the tracking performance of motion-estimation models. The first metric cumulates over the four instants the errors on landmark location. The second metric integrates the error over a time interval according to an a priori breathing model for the landmark spatiotemporal trajectory. This latter metric better takes into account the dynamics of the motion. A second aim of this paper is to estimate the impact of considering several phases of the respiratory cycle as compared to using only the extreme phases (end-inspiration and end-expiration). The accuracy of three motion estimation models (two image registration-based methods and a biomechanical method) is compared through the proposed metrics and statistical tools. This paper points out the interest of taking into account more frames for reliably tracking the respiratory motion.},

abstract = {Shape indexing, classification, and retrieval are fundamental problems in computer graphics. This work introduces a novel method for surface indexing and classification based on Teichmuller theory. The Teichmuller space for surfaces with the same topology is a finite dimensional manifold, where each point represents a conformal equivalence class, a curve represents a deformation process from one class to the other. We apply Teichmuller space coordinates as shape descriptors, which are succinct, discriminating and intrinsic; invariant under the rigid motions and scalings, insensitive to resolutions. Furthermore, the method has solid theoretic foundation, and the computation of Teichmuller coordinates is practical, stable and efficient. This work focuses on the surfaces with negative Euler numbers, which have a unique conformal Riemannian metric with -1 Gaussian curvature. The coordinates which we will compute are the lengths of a special set of geodesics under this special metric. The metric can be obtained by the curvature flow algorithm, the geodesics can be calculated using algebraic topological method. We tested our method extensively for indexing and comparison of about one hundred of surfaces with various topologies, geometries and resolutions. The experimental results show the efficacy and efficiency of the length coordinate of the Teichmuller space.},

@article{kimmel,
abstract = {The medial axis transform (MAT) of a shape, better known as its skeleton, is frequently used in shape analysis and related areas. In this paper a new approach for determining the skeleton of an object, is presented. The boundary is segmented at points of maximal positive curvature and a distance map from each of the segments is calculated. The skeleton is then located by applying simple rules to the zero sets of distance maps differences. A framework is proposed for numerical approximation of distance maps that is consistent with the continuous case, hence does not suffer from digitization bias due to metrication errors of the implementation on the grid. Subpixel accuracy in distance map calculation is obtained by using gray level information along the boundary of the shape in the numerical scheme. The accuracy of the resulting efficient skeletonization algorithm is demonstrated by several examples. Keywords: Differential Geometry, Distance Map, Medial Axis Transform, Shape Analysis, S...},

@article{Parvez2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel non-parametric polygonal approximation algorithm for digital planar curves. The proposed algorithm first selects a set of points (called cut-points) on the contour which are of very âhighâ curvature. An optimization procedure is then applied to find adaptively the best fitting polygonal approximations for the different segments of the contour as defined by the cut-points. The optimization procedure uses one of the efficiency measures for polygonal approximation algorithms as the objective function. Our algorithm adaptively locates segments of the contour with different levels of details. The proposed algorithm follows the contour more closely where the level of details on the curve is high, while addressing noise by using suppression techniques. This makes the algorithm very robust for noisy, real-life contours having different levels of details. The proposed algorithm performs favorably when compared with other polygonal approximation algorithms using the popular shapes. In addition, the effectiveness of the algorithm is shown by measuring its performance over a large set of handwritten Arabic characters and MPEG7 CE Shape-1 Part B database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is very stable and robust compared with other algorithms.},

abstract = {Given a smooth compact codimension one submanifold S of Rk and a compact approximation K of S, we prove that it is possible to reconstruct S and to approximate the medial axis of S with topological guarantees using unions of balls centered on K. We consider two notions of noisy-approximation that generalize sampling conditions introduced by Amenta \& al. and Dey \& al. Our results are based upon critical point theory for distance functions. For the two approximation conditions, we prove that the connected components of the boundary of unions of balls centered on K are isotopic to S. Our results allow to consider balls of different radii. For the first approximation condition, we also prove that a subset (known as the $\lambda$ medial axis) of the medial axis of Rk$\backslash$K is homotopy equivalent to the medial axis of S. We obtain similar results for smooth compact submanifolds S of Rk of any codimension.},

abstract = {Naive discrete planes are well known to be functional on a coordinate plane. The aim of our paper is to extend the functionality concept to a larger family of arithmetic discrete planes, by introducing suitable projection directions ([alpha]1, [alpha]2, [alpha]3) satisfying [alpha]1v1 + [alpha]2v2 + [alpha]3v3 = w. Several applications are considered. We first study certain local configurations, that is, the (m, n)-cubes introduced in Ref. [J. Vittone, J.-M. Chassery, (n,m)-cubes and Farey Nets for Naive Planes Understanding, in: DGCI, 8th International Conference, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1568, Springer-Verlag, 1999, pp. 76-87.]. We compute their number for a given (m, n) and study their statistical behaviour.

This paper is a continuation of our works (Ronse and Tajine, J. Math. Imaging Vision 12 (3) (2000) 219; Hausdorff discretization for cellular distances, and its relation to cover and supercover discretization (to be revised for JVCIR), 2000, Wagner et al., An Approach to Discretization Based on the Hausdorff Metric. I. ISMM\{'\}98, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 1998, pp. 67-74), in which we have studied some properties of Hausdorff discretizations of compact sets.In this paper, we study the properties of Hausdorff discretization for metrics induced by a norm and we refine this study for the class of homogeneous metrics. We prove that for such metrics the popular covering discretizations are Hausdorff discretizations. We also compare the Hausdorff discretization with the Bresenham discretization (Bresenham, IBM Systems J. 4 (1) (1965) 25). Actually, we prove that the Bresenham discretization of a straight line of is not always a good discretization relatively to the Hausdorff metric. This result is an extension of Tajine et al. (Hausdorff Discretization and its Comparison with other Discretization Schemes, DGCI\{'\}99, Paris, Lecture Notes in Computer Sciences Vol. 1568, Springer, Berlin, 1999, pp. 399-410), in which we prove the same result for a segment of . Finally, we study how some topological properties of the Euclidean plane are translated in discrete space for Hausdorff discretizations. Actually, we prove that a Hausdorff discretization of a connected closed set is 8-connected and its maximal Hausdorff discretization is 4-connected for homogeneous metrics.},

An approximate length of the digital curve is determined by calculating the length of the continuous B-spline curve. In the paper several examples are presented and the calculated lengths are compared to other methods found in the literature. The advantage of the proposed method is in the approximation of the digital curve with the continuous curve rather than with piecewise linear sections used by most other methods.},

abstract = {Lower envelopes are fundamental structures in computational geometry that have many applications, such as computing general Voronoi diagrams and performing hidden surface removal in computer graphics. We present a generic, robust and efficient implementation of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing the envelopes of surfaces in R3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exact implementation that computes envelopes in three-dimensional space. Our implementation is based on Cgal (the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) and is designated as a Cgal package. The separation of topology and geometry in our solution allows for the reuse of the algorithm with different families of surfaces, provided that a small set of geometric objects and operations on them is supplied. We used our algorithm to compute the lower and upper envelope for several types of surfaces. Exact arithmetic is typically slower than floating-point arithmetic, espe- cially when higher order surfaces are involved. Since our implementation follows the exact geometric computation paradigm, we minimize the number of geometric operations, and by that significantly improve the performance of the algorithm in practice. Our experiments show interesting phenomena in the behavior of the divide-and-conquer algorithm and the combinatorics of lower envelopes of random surfaces.},

@article{Zunic2010,
abstract = {In this paper we propose a new circularity measure which defines the degree to which a shape differs from a perfect circle. The new measure is easy to compute and, being area based, is robustâe.g., with respect to noise or narrow intrusions. Also, it satisfies the following desirable properties: â¢ it ranges over (0,1] and gives the measured circularity equal to 1 if and only if the measured shape is a circle;â¢ it is invariant with respect to translations, rotations and scaling. Compared with the most standard circularity measure, which considers the relation between the shape area and the shape perimeter, the new measure performs better in the case of shapes with boundary defects (which lead to a large increase in perimeter) and in the case of compound shapes. In contrast to the standard circularity measure, the new measure depends on the mutual position of the components inside a compound shape. Also, the new measure performs consistently in the case of shapes with very small (i.e., close to zero) measured circularity. It turns out that such a property enables the new measure to measure the linearity of shapes. In addition, we propose a generalisation of the new measure so that shape circularity can be computed while controlling the impact of the relative position of points inside the shape. An additional advantage of the generalised measure is that it can be used for detecting small irregularities in nearly circular shapes damaged by noise or during an extraction process in a particular image processing task.},

The aim of the study is to establish whether or not there is a correlation between three-dimensional (3-D) trabecular changes and two-dimensional (2-D) fractal descriptors. Using a highly collimated beam, 3-D bone X-ray tomographic images were obtained. Trabecular bone loss was simulated using a mathematical morphology method. Then, 2-D projections were generated in each of the three orthogonal directions. Finally, the model of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) was used on bone XTM 2-D projections to characterize changes in bone structure that occur during disease, such a simulation of bone loss. Results indicate that fBm is a robust texture model allowing quantification of simulations of trabecular bone changes.},

abstract = {Computerized image analysis makes statements about the continuous world by looking at a discrete representation. Therefore, it is important to know precisely which information is preserved during digitization. We analyze this question in the context of shape recognition. Existing results in this area are based on very restricted models and thus not applicable to real imaging situations. We present generalizations in several directions: first, we introduce a new shape similarity measure that approximates human perception better. Second, we prove a geometric sampling theorem for arbitrary dimensional spaces. Third, we extend our sampling theorem to two-dimensional images that are subjected to blurring by a disk point spread function. Our findings are steps towards a general sampling theory for shapes that shall ultimately describe the behavior of real optical systems.},

abstract = {Centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT) are widely used in computational science and engineering. The most commonly used method is Lloyd's method, and recently the L-BFGS method is shown to be faster than Lloyd's method for computing the CVT. However, these methods run on the CPU and are still too slow for many practical applications. We present techniques to implement these methods on the GPU for computing the CVT on 2D planes and on surfaces, and demonstrate significant speedup of these GPU-based methods over their CPU counterparts. For CVT computation on a surface, we use a geometry image stored in the GPU to represent the surface for computing the Voronoi diagram on it. In our implementation a new technique is proposed for parallel regional reduction on the GPU for evaluating integrals over Voronoi cells.},

abstract = {We develop the pruned continuous Haar transform and the fast continuous Fourier series, two fast and efficient algorithms for rectilinear polygons. Rectilinear polygons are used in VLSI processes to describe design and mask layouts of integrated circuits. The Fourier representation is at the heart of many of these processes and the Haar transform is expected to play a major role in techniques envisioned to speed up VLSI design. To ensure correct printing of the constantly shrinking transistors and simultaneously handle their increasingly large number, ever more computationally intensive techniques are needed. Therefore, efficient algorithms for the Haar and Fourier transforms are vital. We derive the complexity of both algorithms and compare it to that of discrete transforms traditionally used in VLSI. We find a significant reduction in complexity when the number of vertices of the polygons is small, as is the case in VLSI layouts. This analysis is completed by an implementation and a benchmark of the continuous algorithms and their discrete counterpart. We show that on tested VLSI layouts the pruned continuous Haar transform is 5 to 25 times faster, while the fast continuous Fourier series is 1.5 to 3 times faster.},

However, all the optimal algorithms for the computation of the exact Euclidean DT (EDT) were proposed only since the 1990s. In this work, state-of-the-art sequential 2D EDT algorithms are reviewed and compared, in an effort to reach more solid conclusions regarding their differences in speed and their exactness. Six of the best algorithms were fully implemented and compared in practice.},

@article{Fouard2006,
abstract = {The study of cerebral microvascular networks requires high-resolution images. However, to obtain statistically relevant results, a large area of the brain (several square millimeters) must be analyzed. This leads us to consider huge images, too large to be loaded and processed at once in the memory of a standard computer. To consider a large area, a compact representation of the vessels is required. The medial axis is the preferred tool for this application. To extract it, a dedicated skeletonization algorithm is proposed. Numerous approaches already exist which focus on computational efficiency. However, they all implicitly assume that the image can be completely processed in the computer memory, which is not realistic with the large images considered here. We present in this paper a skeletonization algorithm that processes data locally (in subimages) while preserving global properties (i.e., homotopy). We then show some results obtained on a mosaic of three-dimensional images acquired by confocal microscopy.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the design of an effective method that computes the measure of circularity of a part of a digital boundary. An existing circularity measure of a set of discrete points, which is used in computational metrology, is extended to the case of parts of digital boundaries. From a single digital boundary, two sets of points are extracted so that the circularity measure computed from these sets is representative of the circularity of the digital boundary. Therefore, the computation consists of two steps. First, the inner and outer sets of points are extracted from the input part of a digital boundary using digital geometry tools. Next, the circularity measure of these sets is computed using classical tools of computational geometry. It is proved that the algorithm is linear in time in the case of convex parts thanks to the specificity of digital data, and is in  otherwise. Experiments done on synthetic and real images illustrate the interest of the properties of the circularity measure.},

abstract = {A distance field is a representation where, at each point within the field, we know the distance from that point to the closest point on any object within the domain. In addition to distance, other properties may be derived from the distance field, such as the direction to the surface, and when the distance field is signed, we may also determine if the point is internal or external to objects within the domain. The distance field has been found to be a useful construction within the areas of computer vision, physics, and computer graphics. This paper serves as an exposition of methods for the production of distance fields, and a review of alternative representations and applications of distance fields. In the course of this paper, we present various methods from all three of the above areas, and we answer pertinent questions such as How accurate are these methods compared to each other? How simple are they to implement?, and What is the complexity and runtime of such methods?},

A trio of new trigonometric functions are defined in this paper to facilitate the rotation transformations. A fast algorithm for rounding an arbitrary point to the nearest hexagonal grid point is also presented.},

In particular, we determine the "similarity" of two given surfaces by solving a mass-transportation problem between their conformal densities. This mass transportation problem differs from the standard case in that we require the solution to be invariant under global M$\backslash$"obius transformations. Our approach provides a constructive way of defining a metric in the abstract space of simply-connected smooth surfaces with boundary (i.e. surfaces of disk-type); this metric can also be used to define meaningful intrinsic distances between pairs of "patches" in the two surfaces, which allows automatic alignment of the surfaces. We provide numerical experiments on "real-life" surfaces to demonstrate possible applications in natural sciences.},

@article{Bhowmick2007,
abstract = {Several existing DSS (digital straight line segment) recognition algorithms can be used to determine the digital straightness of a given one-pixel-thick digital curve. Because of the inherent geometric constraints of digital straightness, these algorithms often produce a large number of segments to cover a given digital curve representing a real-life object=image. Thus, a curve segment, which is not exactly digitally straight, but appears to be visually straight, is fragmented into multiple DSS when these algorithms are run. In this paper, a new concept of approximate straightness is introduced by relaxing certain conditions of DSS, and an algorithm is described to extract those segments from a digital curve. The number of such segments required to cover the curve is found to be significantly fewer than that of the exact DSS-cover. As a result, the data set required for representing a curve also reduces to a large extent. The extracted set of segments can further be combined to determine a compact polygonal approximation of a digital curve based on certain approximation criteria and a specified error tolerance. The proposed algorithm involves only primitive integer operations and thus runs very fast compared to those based on exact DSS. The overall time complexity becomes linear in the number of points present in the representative set. Experimental results on several digital curves demonstrate the speed, elegance and efficacy of the proposed method.},

@article{Lee2001,
abstract = {In medical applications, three-dimensional volume data such as CT and MRI are gathered from medical-imaging devices. Marching cube (MC) algorithm is a common routine to extract isosurfaces from volume data. The MC algorithm generates the massive number of triangles to represent an isosurface. It is difficult to render this amount of triangles in real-time on general workstations. In this paper, we present a growing-cube algorithm to reduce the number of triangles generated by the MC algorithm. Growing-cube algorithm uses a surface tracker to avoid exhaustive searching isosurfaces cell-by-cell and, therefore, it saves computation time. During surface tracking, the growing-cube algorithm adaptively merges surfaces contained in the tracked cells to reduce the number of triangles. Surfaces are merged as long as the error is within user-specified error thresholds. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can generate a variable resolution of isosurfaces according to these error parameters.},

abstract = {Due to processing constraints, automatic image-based registration of medical images has been largely used as a pre-operative tool. We propose a novel method named sort and count for efficient parallelization of mutual information (MI) computation designed for massively multi-processing architectures. Combined with a parallel transformation implementation and an improved optimization algorithm, our method achieves real-time (less than 1s) rigid registration of 3D medical images using a commodity graphics processing unit (GPU). This represents a more than 50-fold improvement over a standard implementation on a CPU. Real-time registration opens new possibilities for development of improved and interactive intraoperative tools that can be used for enhanced visualization and navigation during an intervention.},

@article{Hildebrand1999,
abstract = {The appearance of cancellous bone architecture is different for various skeletal sites and various disease states. During aging and disease, plates are perforated and connecting rods are dissolved. There is a continuous shift from one structural type to the other. So traditional histomorphometric procedures, which are based on a fixed model type, will lead to questionable results. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) measuring techniques in bone research makes it possible to capture the actual architecture of cancellous bone without assumptions of the structure type. This requires, however, new methods that make direct use of the 3D information. Within the framework of a BIOMED I project of the European Union, we analyzed a total of 260 human bone biopsies taken from five different skeletal sites (femoral head, vertebral bodies L2 and L4, iliac crest, and calcaneus) from 52 donors. The samples were measured three-dimensionally with a microcomputed tomography scanner and subsequently evaluated with both traditional indirect histomorphometric methods and newly developed direct ones. The results show significant differences between the methods and in their relation to the bone volume fraction. Based on the direct 3D analysis of human bone biopsies, it appears that samples with a lower bone mass are primarily characterized by a smaller plate-to-rod ratio, and to a lesser extent by thinner trabecular elements.},

abstract = {Angular radial transform (ART), which is the region-based shape descriptor of MPEG-7, has desirable properties for representing shape information in a small number of features with no redundancy. However, in order for ART to be useful, especially in limited computing environments, the computational cost of ART must be greatly reduced. In this paper, we derive symmetric/antisymmetric properties from the basis functions of ART and present a fast and efficient method to compute the ART coefficients using these properties. The proposed method significantly reduces the number of sinusoidal operations and multiplications in computing the coefficients of ART. Moreover, the memory requirements needed to store the ART basis functions in lookup tables are only 25\% of the conventional method. The experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Balls and spheres are amongst the simplest 3D modeling primitives, and computing the volume of a union of balls is an elementary problem. Although a number of strategies addressing this problem have been investigated in several communities, we are not aware of any robust algorithm, and present the first such algorithm. Our calculation relies on the decomposition of the volume of the union into convex regions, namely the restrictions of the balls to their regions in the power diagram. Theoretically, we establish a formula for the volume of a restriction, based on Gaussâ divergence theorem. The proof being constructive, we develop the associated algorithm. On the implementation side, we carefully analyse the predicates and constructions involved in the volume calculation, and present a certified implementation relying on interval arithmetic. The result is certified in the sense that the exact volume belongs to the interval computed using the interval arithmetic. Experimental results are presented on hand-crafted models presenting various difficulties, as well as on the 58,898 models found in the 2009-07-10 release of the Protein Data Bank.},

abstract = {Segmentation of 3D images of granular materials obtained by microtomography is not an easy task. Because of the conditions of acquisition and the nature of the media, the available images are not exploitable without a reliable method of extraction of the grains. The high connectivity in the medium, the disparity of the object's shape and the presence of image imperfections make classical segmentation methods (using image gradient and watershed constrained by markers) extremely difficult to perform efficiently. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric method using the stochastic watershed, allowing to estimate a 3D probability map of contours. Procedures allowing to extract final segmentation from this function are then presented.},

abstract = {Ridges have been observed at the bonds between sintering snow grains. Images collected using the scanning electron microscope î¾SEMî¡ and x-ray analysis of Antarctic snow are presented. These indicate the ridges are composed from soluble impurity and not ice or water as previously suggested. The ridges can be explained by the coagulation of soluble impurities distributed either at the grain boundaries or on the grain surface. Coagulation is most likely to occur as a result of sublimation during the preparation of the snow specimens for SEM examination, however, they could also form under specific temperature conditions in the snow pack. Consequently, a theory of grain boundary diffusion is not required to explain the presence of ridges at snow bonds.},

abstract = {Les propri\'{e}t\'{e}s de transfert de fluides dans le milieu poreux sont li\'{e}es \`{a} la complexit\'{e} g\'{e}om\'{e}trique de la structure du r\'{e}seau. Cette structure complexe est caract\'{e}ris\'{e}e par des propri\'{e}t\'{e}s g\'{e}om\'{e}triques li\'{e}es \`{a} la forme (morphologiques) et \`{a} la connexion (topologiques) entre les pores. Un des premiers objectifs de ce travail est de caract\'{e}riser la microstructure par le d\'{e}veloppement des m\'{e}thodologies de description topologique de la g\'{e}om\'{e}trie en 3D. Ces op\'{e}rateurs g\'{e}om\'{e}triques sont bas\'{e}s sur la math\'{e}matique algorithmique (g\'{e}om\'{e}trie discr\`{e}te) permettant de r\'{e}duire l'information \`{a} des "squelettes" discrets. L'application des squelettes permet la d\'{e}termination d'une "fonction de distribution topologique" bas\'{e}e sur une description du type de r\'{e}seaux (sites et liens). Les descripteurs de forme sont ensuite appliqu\'{e}s sur des \'{e}chantillons g\'{e}n\'{e}r\'{e}s num\'{e}riquement (g\'{e}om\'{e}tries simples, complexes et "fissur\'{e}es"). Ainsi, diverses analyses morphologiques et topologiques sont r\'{e}alis\'{e}es pour \'{e}tudier le rapport g\'{e}om\'{e}trique entre les sections et leurs volumes respectifs. Le deuxi\`{e}me objectif de ce travail est la mod\'{e}lisation des processus de transferts de fluides \`{a} travers des squelettes. Deux m\'{e}thodes sont pr\'{e}sent\'{e}es: une m\'{e}thode g\'{e}om\'{e}trique et une bas\'{e}e sur l'analogie \'{e}lectrique. La m\'{e}thode de simulation g\'{e}om\'{e}trique est appliqu\'{e}e sur les sections et les volumes pour l'observation de l'influence de la topologie dans l'intrusion et l'extrusion d'un fluide non-mouillant. Un mod\`{e}le de pores cylindriques \'{e}l\'{e}mentaires connect\'{e}s est propos\'{e} pour estimer une conductivit\'{e} hydraulique \`{a} saturation \`{a} partir du "graphe" associ\'{e} au squelette. La m\'{e}thode de simulation utilise une analogie \'{e}lectrique \`{a} travers d'une solution num\'{e}rique optimis\'{e}e pour r\'{e}soudre le syst\`{e}me. La comparaison des r\'{e}sultats entre les structures permet d'observer l'influence de la complexit\'{e} g\'{e}om\'{e}trique du r\'{e}seau sur les propri\'{e}t\'{e}s de transfert.},

abstract = {X-ray diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) is a technique for mapping grain shape and orientation in plastically undeformed polycrystals. In this paper, we describe a modified DCT data acquisition strategy which permits the incorporation of an innovative Friedel pair method for analyzing diffraction data. Diffraction spots are acquired during a 360 degrees rotation of the sample and are analyzed in terms of the Friedel pairs ((hkl) and (hkl) reflections, observed 180 degrees apart in rotation). The resulting increase in the accuracy with which the diffraction vectors are determined allows the use of improved algorithms for grain indexing (assigning diffraction spots to the grains from which they arise) and reconstruction. The accuracy of the resulting grain maps is quantified with reference to synchrotron microtomography data for a specimen made from a beta titanium system in which a second phase can be precipitated at grain boundaries, thereby revealing the grain shapes. The simple changes introduced to the DCT methodology are equally applicable to other variants of grain mapping.},

@inproceedings{Cao2010,
abstract = {We propose a Parallel Banding Algorithm (PBA) on the GPU to compute the exact Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) for a bi- nary image in 2D and higher dimensions. Partitioning the image into small bands to process and then merging them concurrently, PBA computes the exact EDT with optimal linear total work, high level of parallelism and a good memory access pattern. Thiswork is the first attempt to exploit the enormous power of the GPU in com- puting the exact EDT, while priorworks are only on approximation. Compared to these other algorithms in our experiments, our exact algorithm is still a few times faster in 2D and 3D for most input sizes. We illustrate the use of our algorithm in applications such as computing the Euclidean skeleton using the integer medial axis transform, performing morphological operations of 3D volumetric data, and constructing 2D weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams.},
